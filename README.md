# AngularCamp example AngularJS modular App
This will be the final result of the workshop that I'm going to make at AngularCamp event:
https://github.com/AngularCamp/angularcamp.org/issues/60

## Seed
https://github.com/GinesOrtiz/AngularJS-Vitamin

## Idea
In the workshop I'll explain how to make a modular app using AngularJS. We are going to use an API for searching movies and tvshows. The application will have a search option, a list of results and a detail card with all the movie information.

## Tools
Some of the tools I'm going to use are: SASS, Bower and Gulp. The IDE I'll use is Webstorm (I'm going to make another workshop about webstorm https://github.com/AngularCamp/angularcamp.org/issues/59 )
